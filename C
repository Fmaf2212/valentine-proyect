# AGENTS.md

This repository is a small static web experience (HTML/CSS/JS) with no build system.
Use these notes when making changes as an automated agent.

## Quick Facts
- Project type: static site, no bundler
- Languages: HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript
- Entry point: `index.html`
- Runtime: browser only

## Build, Lint, Test
There is no configured build, lint, or test tool in this repo.
If you add tooling, update this section accordingly.

### Run the app (manual)
- Open `index.html` directly in a browser
- Or serve the folder to avoid file:// quirks:
  - `python -m http.server 8000`
  - Then visit `http://localhost:8000/`

### Lint
- No linter configured

### Tests
- No test framework configured
- Single test: not applicable

### Manual checks (recommended)
- Load `index.html` and confirm the three screens flow correctly
- Hover the “No” button and verify it moves and sparkles render
- Click “Sí” and verify hearts fall continuously
- Check the browser console for errors

## Cursor / Copilot Rules
- No `.cursorrules` found
- No `.cursor/rules/` directory found
- No `.github/copilot-instructions.md` found

## Code Style Guidelines
Follow the existing style in the repo unless a change is required for clarity.

### General
- Keep changes minimal and consistent with the current aesthetic
- Prefer clarity over cleverness; this is a small, direct codebase
- Use Spanish copy and comments to match the existing tone
- Avoid introducing frameworks or build tooling unless requested

### Formatting
- Indentation: 2 spaces
- Keep lines concise; wrap long text in HTML with `<br>` when needed
- Use LF line endings

### HTML
- Use semantic tags where practical (`h1`, `h2`, `p`, `button`)
- Keep structure flat and readable; avoid deep nesting
- Use double quotes for attributes
- IDs are used for screen toggling; keep them unique
- Class names are short, simple, and lowercase

### CSS
- Formatting mirrors current file: selector immediately followed by `{`
- One declaration per line; end all declarations with `;`
- Prefer hex colors and gradients as in the existing palette
- Keep animations in CSS using `@keyframes`
- Use class selectors over IDs for styling
- Avoid heavy resets; only add what is needed

### JavaScript
- Use `const` by default; `let` only when reassigned
- Use double quotes for strings
- Use arrow functions for event handlers and simple callbacks
- Keep DOM logic straightforward and local
- Avoid global pollution; use `const` bindings at top scope

### Imports / Modules
- No module system is in use; keep everything in `script.js`
- Do not introduce bundler-specific imports without a build step

### Naming Conventions
- IDs: camelCase (`screen1`, `yesBtn`)
- Classes: lowercase short names (`screen`, `card`, `float`)
- Functions: camelCase verbs (`createSparkles`, `startHearts`)
- Variables: camelCase, descriptive but short (`sparkles`, `container`)

### Error Handling
- Guard DOM lookups if you add new elements or defer scripts
- If adding async behavior, handle failures with clear fallbacks
- Prefer early returns over nested `if` blocks for edge cases

### Accessibility and UX
- Ensure buttons remain reachable on small screens
- Keep color contrast readable against the gradient background
- Use motion sparingly; avoid excessive flashing or strobing

### Animation Guidelines
- Use CSS keyframes for continuous motion
- Use `setInterval` or `requestAnimationFrame` only when needed
- Clean up DOM nodes after animation completes (as done now)

### DOM and Events
- Keep event listener setup near related logic
- Avoid adding listeners in loops unless necessary
- Use `classList` for visibility toggles (`active` class)

## File Layout Notes
- `index.html` defines three screens and references CSS/JS
- `styles.css` contains layout, gradient, buttons, and animations
- `script.js` handles screen switching and effects

## Agent Behavior in This Repo
- Do not delete user-visible text without explicit instruction
- Preserve the romantic/celebratory tone in Spanish copy
- If changing visuals, keep the overall Valentine theme
- When adding new features, document any new commands here

## If You Add Tooling (Future)
If you introduce a formatter, linter, or tests, add:
- Install command
- Run command
- Single-test command example
- Any required config files
